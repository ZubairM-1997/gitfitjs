This is my 3rd project at Flatiron School. It's the same idea as my previous Rails app but the Front-end is purely in Vanilla JavasScript and the back end is using Rails as an API.
To view the app, follow the instructions below

1. fork and clone
2. go to the gitfit-server directory by saying "cd gitfit-server" in the terminal
3. boot up the rails server by using "rails s" in the console 
4. go to the gitfit-client directory by saying "cd gitfit-client" in the terminal
5. type "open index.html" in the console 
6. Enjoy the app


DISCLAIMER: 
I have not included an authentication inside this app as I have yet to implement it in JavaScript. So you will have to reset the database everytime you refresh in order for the database to persist
1. go to the server directory and type "rails db:reset" in the console
2. then type "rails db:migrate" 
3. Repeat this everytime you "accidentally" refresh the page
